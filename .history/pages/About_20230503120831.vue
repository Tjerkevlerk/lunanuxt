    Why travel with us?
    We are a team of safari experts in Tanzania and other Eastern and Southern African countries with over 10 years of
    experience in organizing and operating tours to world class African national parks, excursions to Zanzibar and
    Kilimanjaro climbs, trips to Victoria Falls and desert safaris in Namibia, and adventures in other fascinating places
    in the region.
    We are a local licensed tour operator, which means that we develop and operate our safaris independently: we provide
    turn-key travel solutions without any intermediary agents.
    Professional safari guides, fluent in several languages: English, Dutch, Ukrainian, Russian, Portuguese, Polish.
    Toyota Land Cruiser safari vehicles are in excellent condition and regularly serviced. The roof of the vehicle opens
    up, providing undisturbed photography opportunities. The cars have sockets for charging your devices, a radioset, a
    refrigerator with drinking water, and a pair of binoculars.
    For transfers in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania we use modern Toyota Alphard Minivans.
